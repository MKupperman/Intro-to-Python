A lightweight introduction to Python for mathematicians. 
This repository contains the contents from the introduction session done in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) in [Intro to Python](intro_to_Python_full.ipynb).

A [sample project](Sample-repository) demonstrating how to write a [local module](Sample-repository/main/mymath), use [pytest for tests](Sample-repository/tests), file IO with [scipy.io](Sample-repository/main/fileIO.py), and classes is included.

A practical introduction for [getting started with Anaconda](Anaconda_Notes.txt) is also included.
